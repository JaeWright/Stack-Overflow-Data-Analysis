#### Introduction:

    The topic we are reporting on is the results of the “2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey”. Stack Overflow’s annual survey has been the largest survey of programmers for over 10 years, which includes a massively diverse range of data from around the world. The survey was taken by nearly 65,000 people from the United States to Afghanistan.
    
    The most interesting aspect of the survey was the variety of questions asked. Many of the questions entail personal and work information which is informative, yet boring. More interestingly, however, are the questions which are about “for-fun” topics. For example, the dataset shows that 52% of respondents think “Hello, old friend” when searching for a coding solution online and notice that the link they are about to click on is purple, indicating that they have already visited the link. Not all of these “for-fun: topics are entirely useless, however. When asked about the steps taken when stuck on a coding problem, 90% of respondents indicate that they visit Stack Overflow for solutions. Like this question, many of the questions in the survey have a use in a massive variety of ways.
    
    Unfortunately, because of how versatile this dataset is, it would be impossible to evaluate every aspect of it. We decided to focus on the personal information regarding programmers around the globe, and reveal information about their work environments and job preferences.

#### Discussion:

    As a whole our results were what we expected based on current trends in the developer scene, and the ongoing change in the tech industry, however there were some results that caught our attention.
    We found that the average developer that identifies as a person of color (POC) makes about $20,000 dollars less per year in total compensation than one that doesn't identify as a POC. The result was shocking as we found both groups on average worked 40 hours per week.

    From the graphs we created from the data, we found that the amount of non-POC developers almost doubled the amount of POC developers. From this observation we were able to infer that the stagger in salary numbers could be a result of the sample size difference for both groups. From the graphs we can see that the non-POC group has a better normal distribution thanks to its greater population in the average range of the data set($100K salary and 40 hours a week). This observation led us to question the actual diversity of POC in the developer workspace. We found that in the current hiring scene for developers, though efforts are being made to better diversify the space, we still have a long way to go. The pay gap may also be tributed to the lack of POC in senior or managerial positions. 

    From our analysis of the surrey data we also found the trends and factors that developers look into when considering a place for work.

    As expected in any job market, the biggest reason a developer would choose to leave their job for a different one was for better compensation. Tech giants like Google and Facebook pay very good money to their developers, it’s no wonder that we found only about 7% of developers working in large corporations were very dissatisfied with their jobs. A result that peaked our interest however, was that the most important factors after money had to do with progression in the field. Whether that be using new technologies, or being able to promote to more senior or leadership positions. It seems that the culture of developers is to always meet the demand of the future. It makes sense that developers would look to constantly expand their skill sets and also find that there are many developers without degrees who are making the same amount of money as those with further education. The developer scene values skills rather than education level. 

#### Conclusion:

    In conclusion we were able to analyse many trends of developers which gave us a better insight into the tech industry as a whole. We were able to figure out the distribution of POC in the development scene and use that information to better understand the structure of the senior hierarchy in most companies. Additionally we found developers care most about money and progression in their jobs. This gave us an insight into the recruiting side of the developer community, and how one can be more appealing in a position, as well as what factors may be the best for producing results at work.
    
    Our group has learned many things as we worked on the project. Mainly, we each learned new coding tricks and techniques to make our life easier while coding. There are many different ways of approaching a problem, with many solutions being correct. What our group tried to focus on was finding the easiest, most understandable way of writing functional code. However, our methods still remained uniquely different for each member.
    
    If we were to improve our project, we could improve our work’s consistency. Because our group approached each question differently, it led to different forms of results that may be disorienting for a viewer. Although having different forms of coding can be very beneficial for learning new forms of problem solving, presenting the work is best done in a single format so that the viewer is ready and prepared to digest the information being presented to them.
